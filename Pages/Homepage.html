                            <h2>About Me:</h2>
                            <p style="align-content: inherit;">I am currently a student at the University of North Texas and majoring in Technical Communication with a minor in English. 
                                    I am interning within Enterprise Risk and Management as a Technical Writer at Mr.Cooper (formerly NationStar Mortgage). </br>
                            </br>I edit, create and manage documents through Archer and SharePoint sites while communicating with SME’s daily. To date, I have over 100 documents that have gone through the publishing process with more to come. Our Change Governance team has 15 people that cover technical support for Archer, Documentation Administration, Change of Law and governing the company’s Style Guide. 
                                    I have expanded my knowledge of HTML and I am in the process of learning the ins and outs of SharePoint sites, excel, Kompozer, and corporate policy. </br></br>
                                    I have also moved to documenting procedures through Process Maps. I currently use VISIO to transfer procedures and update them as needed. I meet with SME's and whole teams to help update and document new processes at high level. I have created and reviewed over 50 process maps that are currently in use at Mr.Cooper.</p>
